# Unbuilt Specification

### Overview
The Rails Asset Pipeline is a library designed for organizing, caching, and serving static assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and image files. It streamlines and optimizes the management of these assets to enhance the performance and maintainability of the application. Refer the official [documentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html) for more details. Now, the goal of this project is to implement the Rails Asset Pipeline framework and nobuild stack in other langauges. 

**Note**: Please note that when I say "specification," it refers to a list of features the tool should have and what each feature must do.
